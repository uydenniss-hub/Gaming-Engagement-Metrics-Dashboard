## Overview
This project analyzes **200+ video game session records** to explore player engagement and monetization patterns. The data was cleaned and structured in Excel, then transformed into an **interactive dashboard** highlighting key KPIs.

## Objectives
- Practice **end-to-end Excel analysis**: data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and storytelling.  
- Track and interpret **gaming KPIs**: DAU/WAU, win rates, conversion to paying users, and session behavior.  
- Build a **portfolio-ready dashboard** demonstrating applied data analytics skills.  

## Dataset
- ~200 player session records (sample data)  
- Columns include: `date`, `user_id`, `platform`, `region`, `game_mode`, `session_minutes`, `matches_played`, `wins`, `latency_ms`, `spend_usd`, and more.  

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ removed duplicates, flagged impossible values, standardized region names.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis** â€“ PivotTables to calculate KPIs and segment performance.  
3. **Visualization** â€“ charts, KPI tiles, and slicers for interactivity.  
4. **Storytelling** â€“ insights framed around player engagement, retention, and monetization.  

## Key Insights
- DAU/WAU ratio shows strong stickiness among North American players.  
- PvP sessions had higher conversion rates to paying users compared to PvE.  
- Mobile sessions were shorter but monetized at a higher rate per active user.
